## Usage
 Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the burgers ready section side of the page -- waiting to be eaten.
 
 Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Ready to eat!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the Burgers eaten section of the page.
